# Python-
# Smart Home IoT Simulator
# Overview
The Smart Home IoT Simulator is a Python-based application that simulates the behavior of a smart home automation system. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with various simulated smart devices like lights, thermostats, and security cameras.

# Dependencies
Python 3.x
tkinter (standard library for GUI)
# Modules and Classes
Module: Main
This is the entry point of the application, where instances of devices and the automation system are created, and the GUI is initialized.

# Class: SmartLight
Represents a smart light device with adjustable brightness.

__init__(self, device_id): Constructor that initializes the light with a device ID.
setBrightness(self, brightness): Sets the brightness level of the light.
turn_on(self): Turns on the light.
turn_off(self): Turns off the light.
dim(self): Reduces the brightness of the light slightly.

# Class: Thermostat
Represents a smart thermostat with adjustable temperature.

__init__(self, device_id): Constructor that initializes the thermostat with a device ID.
setTemperature(self, temperature): Sets the temperature.
turn_on(self): Turns on the thermostat.
turn_off(self): Turns off the thermostat.
heat_up(self): Increases the temperature slightly.

# Class: SecurityCamera
Represents a smart security camera.

__init__(self, device_id): Constructor that initializes the camera with a device ID.
turn_on(self): Activates the camera.
turn_off(self): Deactivates the camera.
detect(self, system): Simulates a detection event and triggers the system's light control.

# Class: AutomationSystem
Manages the collection of smart devices.

__init__(self): Constructor that initializes the automation system.
add_device(self, device): Adds a device to the system.
remove_device(self, device_id): Removes a device from the system.
discover_devices(self): Returns a list of device IDs.
turn_on_lights(self): Turns on all lights in the system.

# Class: DeviceGUI
A GUI component for interacting with a specific device.

__init__(self, master, device, system, *args, **kwargs): Constructor that initializes the GUI for a device.
init_ui(self): Sets up the GUI components.
Various other GUI-related methods.
Class: AutomationSystemGUI
The main GUI window for the entire automation system.

__init__(self, system): Constructor that initializes the main GUI.
run(self): Starts the GUI event loop.
Usage
Run the main application script to start the simulator. Interact with the devices through the provided GUI.

Example
python
Copy code
# Main application setup
if __name__ == "__main__":
    system = AutomationSystem()
    light = SmartLight("Living Room Light")
    thermostat = Thermostat("Living Room Thermostat")
    camera = SecurityCamera("Front Door Camera")

    system.add_device(light)
    system.add_device(thermostat)
    system.add_device(camera)

    gui = AutomationSystemGUI(system)
    gui.run()
